# decisions

* Decisions will be a Crowd Sourcing website.

There have been studies that show that the best decision is usually the one that the majority of people agree on.
Decisions will provide a way for you to ask for help with any decisions you are facing.

The decisions could be something as simple as "What should I have for lunch?" With a few options listed, or it could be a huge decision such as "Should I turn myself in on this warrant?" (Just an example).



* The name Decisions is obviously not going to be the name of the website.  It is just a placeholder.
